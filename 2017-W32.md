### 96Boards OpenHours #65: Fedora for 96Boards hardware

96Boards OpenHours is a Linaro effort to provide a weekly discussion
and interview with leaders in the ARM community. Issue 65 is an interview
with Peter Robinson and Paul Whalen of Red Hat, talking about their
efforts to port Fedora to a series of ARM-based single board computers.

Peter and Paul are looking forward to a release in the Fedora 27 timeframe
with support for Linaro's 96Boards. The goal is to have these machines,
like the Hikey 960, booting Fedora from SD card. The published Fedora
timeline has a beta release in mid September 2017, with a target release
in late October 2017.

They note that the state of kernel development for single-board computers
has improved greatly over time, as there used to be nearly a different
kernel needed for each device and a different boot method. Diligent 
efforts to upstream patches into the mainline kernel and to get 
the vendor binary blobs into open licenses has vastly expanded the
number of systems that can be supported.

OpenHours is hosted by Linaro's Robert Wolff.
