### DietPi - a distribution for ARM-based single board computers

DietPi is a lightweight Debian based distribution for single board
ARM computers. It advertises support for vendors including
Allo, Asus, BananaPi, NanoPi, Odroid, OrangePi, Pine, and Raspberry Pi,
plus versions that will run on virtual machines.

The DietPi web site has a handy comparison of the capabilities of
the 64-bit ARM single-board computers that it supports, noting the
various things you might need to think about when making a choice
among them including price, performance, thermal handling and
compatibility. Even if you don't plan to run this particular distribution,
it's a good reference for shopping.

If you're interested in DietPi, you'll probably also be interested
in [Armbian], which is a distribution with the same target pool of
SBCs. Armbian was featured in the W27 issue.

### Electron - port to arm64 in progress

The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  It is based on Node.js
and Chromium and is used by the Atom editor and many other apps.

Work is underway by Hamid Zamani (HAMIDx9) to port this system to arm64.
The pull request includes unofficial builds of Electron, plus
its dependencies FFMpeg and libchromiumcontent. The target
for the official release is the 1.8.x milestone, because
the build process will require a newer toolchain that what's
available to Electron in the 1.7.x release chain.

Among the other apps built on this that are eyeing arm64 support
are a community build of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code managed
by Jay Rodgers (@headmelted).

### Flatpak build infrastructure for arm, aarch64

Flatpak is the next-generation technology for building and installing
desktop applications. It has straightforward cross-compilation
support for generation of ARM and aarch64 binaries in its Intel
based build system.

### 96Boards OpenHours #65: Fedora for 96Boards hardware

96Boards OpenHours is a Linaro effort to provide a weekly discussion
and interview with leaders in the ARM community. Issue 65 is an interview
with Peter Robinson and Paul Whalen of Red Hat, talking about their
efforts to port Fedora to a series of ARM-based single board computers.

Peter and Paul are looking forward to a release in the Fedora 27 timeframe
with support for Linaro's 96Boards. The goal is to have these machines,
like the Hikey 960, booting Fedora from SD card. The published Fedora
timeline has a beta release in mid September 2017, with a target release
in late October 2017.

They note that the state of kernel development for single-board computers
has improved greatly over time, as there used to be nearly a different
kernel needed for each device and a different boot method. Diligent 
efforts to upstream patches into the mainline kernel and to get 
the vendor binary blobs into open licenses has vastly expanded the
number of systems that can be supported.

OpenHours is hosted by Linaro's Robert Wolff.
