### Works on Arm announcement of partnership with Packet, Arm 

Packet and Arm announced the partnership that brings you this newsletter,
plus a commitment to developer access to Arm platforms for development,
test, and continuous integration.

> Packet, the leading provider of automated bare metal for developers, 
today announced a partnership with Arm to support the rapidly expanding 
ecosystem for the ArmÂ®v8-compatible architecture. Through the partnership, 
Packet will provide free on-demand access to Armv8-A bare metal systems from 
Cavium, Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of 
Qualcomm Incorporated, and others - enabling open source and commercial 
software projects to easily test against a variety of datacenter-grade machines.

Look for more details coming in the next few weeks about how access to these resources.
News coverage of the effort has been generally positive, with Data Center Knowledge
saying this:

>  [D]evelopers often require direct access to physical infrastructure to 
build and deploy next-generation workloads that fully utilize the underlying 
hardware capabilities. This also gives them a way to make sure their software 
works on the most basic ARM installation before tweaking it to work and play 
well with someone else's software. There are other reasons as well, but you get the picture.
