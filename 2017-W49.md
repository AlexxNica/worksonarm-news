### Amazon EC2 Bare Metal Instances with Direct Access to Hardware (Jeff Barr, Amazon)

Amazon has announced at their 2017 Las Vegas re:Invent conference
that they would be supporting a "bare metal" option for servers.
These are Intel based systems with custom hardware.

"We don't build snowflakes".

### Is parallel programming hard? (Paul E. McKenney via Jon Masters, Red Hat)

Jon Masters writes on Twitter: "This is some of the best holiday
reading around." He is referring to Paul E. McKenney's new release
of "Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About
It?" aka `perfbook`.

> This update includes more formatting and build-system improvements,
bibliography updates, and better handling of listings, all courtesy
of Akira Yokosawa; numerous fixes and updates from Junchang Wang,
Pierre Kuo, SeongJae Park, and Yubin Ruan; a new futures section
on quantum computing; updates to the formal-verification section
based on recent collaborations; and a full rewrite of the memory-barriers
section, which is now its own chapter. This rewrite was of course
based on recent work with my partners in memory-ordering crime,
Jade Alglave, Luc Maranget, Andrea Parri, and Alan Stern.

### Fedora 27 (Peter Robinson, Red Hat / Fedora)

> Support for ARM 64 bit (aarch64) Single Board Computers (SBCs)
has been one of the most highly requested features along side the
Raspberry Pi. It’s something I’ve been working towards almost as
long too. Finally with Fedora 27 I felt we would have enough of the
bits in place for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
