### Works on Arm Office Hours

Ed Vielmetti (Works on Arm project manager) is hosting
Works on Arm office hours online on Wednesdays. The first
event was on Wednesday, November 15, and saw participation
from Ed Maste (FreeBSD Foundation), Jacob Smith (Packet),
and Dieter Reuter (Hypriot). There is a dedicated Zoom
channel at Packet available, and chat is available 24x7
through the #worksonarm channel on Packet's Community Slack
and on Freenode's #worksonarm IRC channel.

Thanks to out to Mario Loria (Liquid Web) for showing the
way with a great telecast for the Kubernetes #office-hours
team - I'll be learning the tech from the Kubernetes team
which seems to have these real-time chat systems figured out.

### Supercomputing 2017 (SC17)

Most of the news this week is coming out of the SC17 conference
in Denver, which saw a huge amount of news related to Arm in 
high-performance computing. There was representation from
Red Hat, SUSE, Cray, HPE, Cavium, (AND MORE)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Arm

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is now supported on arm64 systems
with RHEL 7.4.  The initial support is expect to target new systems
from HPE.  Jon Masters, Red Hat's "Captain Arm", made the
announcement at SC17.

### Hardware: Cray XC50 with Cavium ThunderX2, Cray compilers

Cray customers will have an Arm-based supercomputer with
Cray's HPC software stack and optimized compilers.
The XC50 targets scientific workloads.

> Building on Cray’s adaptive supercomputing vision, the Cray® XC®
series integrates extreme performance HPC interconnect capabilities
with best-in-class processing technologies to produce a single,
scalable architecture. Understanding that no single processor engine
is ideal for every type of user application, the Cray XC50 system
offers the addition of the 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2™ processor with
the stability and performance of the Cray Linux® Environment, as
well as a premium programming environment in a proven, scalable
infrastructure, making the XC50 system the first production Arm®
supercomputer available.

### Hardware: HPE Apollo 70 with Cavium ThunderX2

At SC17, HPE announced a ThunderX2 based HPE Apollo 70 system.

> The Apollo 70, using Cavium’s 64-bit ARMv8-A ThunderX2™ Server
Processor, is purpose-built for memory intensive HPC workloads and
delivers up to 33 percent more memory bandwidth than today’s industry
standard servers. The Apollo 70 also provides access to HPE’s
partnership ecosystem delivering key HPC components including Red
Hat® Enterprise Linux®, SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server for ARM, and
Mellanox® high-speed InfiniBand & Ethernet fabric solutions.

### Hardware: Bitscope Raspberry Pi cluster at LANL (Gary Grider)

At SC17, Bitscope showed off a 750 node Raspberry Pi cluster,
designed for Los Alamos National Labs as a development and training
system for massively parallel workloads.

> The BitScope Pi Cluster Modules system creates an affordable, scalable, highly parallel testbed for high-performance-computing system-software developers. The system comprises five rack-mounted BitScope Pi Cluster Modules consisting of 3,000 cores using Raspberry Pi ARM processor boards, fully integrated with network switching infrastructure.

### Software: Ubuntu release of Docker 1.13

Canonical has released Docker 1.13 for 16.04 LTS "Xenial". Of note
is that this fixes a long-standing bug where the system
Go 1.6 version guesses wrong when choosing a page size.
