### Supercomputing 2017 (SC17)

Most of the news this week is coming out of the SC17 conference
in Denver, which saw a huge amount of news related to Arm in 
high-performance computing. There were announcements from
Red Hat, Cray, HPE, Cavium, (AND MORE)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Arm

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is now supported on arm64 systems
with RHEL 7.4.  The initial support is expect to target new systems
from HPE (see below).  Jon Masters, Red Hat's (title), made the
announcement at SC17.

### Hardware: Cray XC50 with Cavium ThunderX2, Cray compilers

Cray customers will have an Arm-based supercomputer with
Cray's HPC software stack and optimized compilers.
The XC50 targets scientific workloads.

> Building on Cray’s adaptive supercomputing vision, the Cray® XC®
series integrates extreme performance HPC interconnect capabilities
with best-in-class processing technologies to produce a single,
scalable architecture. Understanding that no single processor engine
is ideal for every type of user application, the Cray XC50 system
offers the addition of the 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2™ processor with
the stability and performance of the Cray Linux® Environment, as
well as a premium programming environment in a proven, scalable
infrastructure, making the XC50 system the first production Arm®
supercomputer available.

### Hardware: HPE Apollo 70 with Cavium ThunderX2

At SC17, HPE announced a ThunderX2 based HPE Apollo 70 system.

> The Apollo 70, using Cavium’s 64-bit ARMv8-A ThunderX2™ Server
Processor, is purpose-built for memory intensive HPC workloads and
delivers up to 33 percent more memory bandwidth than today’s industry
standard servers. The Apollo 70 also provides access to HPE’s
partnership ecosystem delivering key HPC components including Red
Hat® Enterprise Linux®, SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server for ARM, and
Mellanox® high-speed InfiniBand & Ethernet fabric solutions.

### Hardware: Bitscope Raspberry Pi cluster at LANL (Gary Grider)

At SC17, Bitscope showed off a 750 node Raspberry Pi cluster,
designed for Los Alamos National Labs as a development and training
system for massively parallel workloads.

> The BitScope Pi Cluster Modules system creates an affordable, scalable, highly parallel testbed for high-performance-computing system-software developers. The system comprises five rack-mounted BitScope Pi Cluster Modules consisting of 3,000 cores using Raspberry Pi ARM processor boards, fully integrated with network switching infrastructure.

### Software: HPC optimized FORTRAN compilers from Cray

As part of the XC50 announcement, Cray announced FORTRAN compilers
optimized for HPC workloads. The reported performance is (better than)
the free GCC and LLVM based compilers.

### Software: Ubuntu release of Docker 1.13

Canonical has released Docker 1.13 for 16.04 LTS "Xenial". Of note
is that this fixes a long-standing bug where the system
Go 1.6 version guesses wrong when choosing a page size.
