### Hardware: Bitscope Raspberry Pi cluster at LANL (Gary Grider)

At SC17, Bitscope showed off a 750 node Raspberry Pi cluster,
designed for Los Alamos National Labs as a development and training
system for massively parallel workloads.

> The BitScope Pi Cluster Modules system creates an affordable, scalable, highly parallel testbed for high-performance-computing system-software developers. The system comprises five rack-mounted BitScope Pi Cluster Modules consisting of 3,000 cores using Raspberry Pi ARM processor boards, fully integrated with network switching infrastructure.
