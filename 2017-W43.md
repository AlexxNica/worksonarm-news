### Docker and databases for arm64

If you're looking to run on official arm64 Docker container
for your MySQL-based database, you'll find that the official
channels don't provide an answer yet. Some sense of state
of the art:

*MySQL* for Docker's open issue, "support arm64 architecture", has
this comment from Joe F (@yosifkit):

> This would need support from MySQL upstream to release packages for
other architectures in their apt repo. (to me, this seems unlikely
since they don't commercially support much more then i386 and amd64:
https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html )

* https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues/318

*MariaDB* is a fork of MySQL from the original maintainers. It too is
x86 only for now in its official version. From Guillaume Lefranc
(@tanji):

> Hi, arm64 support will not happen because MariaDB Foundation
focuses on intel architecture, the choice of building for other
platforms is left to distribution maintainers. You can find arm64
packages in debian for example.

* https://github.com/docker-library/mariadb/issues/125

*Percona* is another commercial source of MySQL. It too is lacking
an arm64 supported version in Docker, with this comment from @yosifkit

> Percona: no open issue yet, but we are limited by percona.com's
apt repo which only has amd64 and i386 binaries

If you are willing to go with a community supported version of MySQL,
there is a solution. The *LinuxServer.io* team has a community version
of MariaDB available as a Docker image for aarch64 (arm64). 
Please review the image carefully before putting it into production!

*PostgreSQL* is an alternative to MySQL, though not by any means
a drop-in replacement. It has full multi-architecture support available,
with arm64 versions in the supported Docker installation.
