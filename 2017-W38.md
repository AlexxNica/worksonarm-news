### Docker official images are now multi-platform (Docker blog)

From an article on the Docker weblog written by Michael Friis:

> This past week, Docker rolled out a big update to our Official Images 
to make them multi-platform aware. Now, when you run 
`docker run hello-world`, Docker CE and EE will pull and run the 
correct `hello-world` image whether that‚Äôs for x86-64 Linux, 
Windows, ARM, IBM Z mainframes or any other system where Docker 
runs. With Docker rapidly adding support for additional operating 
systems (like Windows) and CPU architectures (like IBM Z) this 
is an important UX improvement.

By using a script provided as a Docker image by Phil Estes of IBM,
`mquery`, I was able to inventory the top 140 "official images" in
the system. Of these, 44 are already available as multi-arch capable
images that support the arm64/linux platform. I'll be keeping track
of that count as time goes forward to assess progress.

### Work in progress: Official multiarch images for Alpine Linux

One of the popular operating system base images for Docker is Alpine Linux,
which provides a very small and functional system to use in base 
containers. Work is in progress to build multiarch Alpine, taking
the work to date that already supports arm64.

From Michael Friis again:

> Because so many of our official images rely on Alpine, we're really 
looking forward to this update. Please let us know if there's any 
help we can offer. @tianon has led the rest of the multi-arch effort 
and would be available to assist if that's useful.

### New Works on Arm website improvements

The Works on Arm website that supports this newsletter has
had a number of improvements released over the past few weeks.
It's now possible to subscribe to a newsfeed of the newsletter,
and entries for many packages have been brought up to date.

We're currently tracking 32 different software packages,
operating system distributions, and programming languages
that offer support for arm64 in some fashion. You know and
I know that that number is really much larger, but also that
some systems have work left to be done to get first-class
support for Arm. One of the goals in coming months is to 
expand out coverage of the ecosystem and validate and
verify more major components.

Does your favorite _ work on Arm? Look for the logo, and if
you don't see it, drop me a note to update.
