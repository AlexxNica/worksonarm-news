### Qualcomm Centriq 2400 benchmarks from Cloudflare (Vlad Krasnov)

> On @Cloudflare's workloads we're seeing equivalent performance
to Intel at half the power. (NAME)

Vlad Krasnov from Cloudflare published the first public
benchmarks of the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 server. He reports
based on real workloads and real code that the Centriq 
delivers comparable performance to Intel servers that cost
more and consume more power. 

> With the NGINX workload Falkor handled almost the same amount of requests as the Skylake server, and both significantly outperform Broadwell. The power readings, taken from the BMC show that it did so while consuming less than half the power of other processors. That means Falkor managed to get 214 requests/watt vs the Skylake’s 99 requests/watt and Broadwell’s 77.

The picture is not all rosy when it comes to language support
for arm64, however. Krasnov's sharpest disappointment is
with the Go language runtimes, which are often not optimized
for arm64 processors:

> Go support for aarch64 is quite disappointing. I am very happy to say that everything compiles and works flawlessly, but on the performance side, things should get better. Is seems like the enablement effort so far was concentrated on the compiler back end, and the library was left largely untouched. There are a lot of low hanging optimization fruits out there, like my 20 minute fix for addMulVVW clearly shows. Qualcomm and other ARMv8 vendors intends to put significant engineering resources to amend this situation, but really any one can contribute to Go. So if you want to leave your mark, now is the time.

### Next generation Qualcomm is "Saphira"/"Firetail"

Eagle-eyed watchers of C and C++ code repositories have
noticed details of Qualcomm's next generation chips. David
Schor of (ORGANIZATION) writes:

> Looks like Qualcomm already started patching LLVM for the Saphira microarchitecture as of a month ago. Saphira will support ARMv8.3 (from v8.0 in Falkor). We'll start tracking changes, see what they're up to!

### Fedora 27 arm64 single-board computer support 

Peter Robinson of the Fedora project discusses the
state of single-board computer (SBC) arm64 support in
Fedora 27.

> "Raspberry Pi 3, the 96boards Dragonboard 410c and HiKey, and a handful of AllWinner devices with a focus on the Pine64 series of boards."

### Issue tracking: Apache HBase dependency on protoc 

Apache HBase fails to build on arm64 due to a dependency on
"protoc", the protocol buffers compiler from Google. The software
is available and works in source form, but HBase depends on the
centralized Maven repository for getting binary artifacts, and
the requisite versions are not there.

### Issue tracking:  

### Issue resolved: use a better random number source for LinuxKit

A team from Docker, Packet, and Arm resolved an issue with
slow performance of Linuxkit. On some hardware, the kernel 
does not expose a hardware random number generator with sufficient
entropy to satisfy Linuxkit's need for randomness. The solution
was a change from using /dev/random to instead using /dev/urandom
as a source of entropy.

### Merge request: Gitlab Runner for arm64 (Niclas NAME)

Niclas NAME from ORGANIZATION has a merge request for Gitlab
to support arm64 in the Gitlab runner, a component of its
continuous integration (CI) system.

This work was supported in part by the Works on Arm project
that runs at Packet.
