It's Works on Arm News for the 50th week of 2017. Snow in 
Austin TX for Kubecon and snow in Ann Arbor MI for editing
this issue.

### Can bugs be useful? Some famous bugs.

> The very word "Bug" suggests something worthless if not actually
repulsive, something suitable only to be eliminated. Yet every Bug, no
matter how humble, gives us at least one important piece of
information; namely, it tells us one more way our System can fail.
Since success is largely a matter of Avoiding the Most Likely Ways to
Fail, and since every Bug advances us significantly along that path, we
may hearken back to the advice given in the preface and urge the following
Policy: CHERISH YOUR BUGS. STUDY THEM.

### Kubecon news 

4000 people are at the CNCF Kubernetes conference, Kubecon, in Austin TX. It
snowed there in a rare December snowstorm. Among the most controversial items
that have come to my attention there is how to pronounce `kubectl`. Lots of
demos and lots of news of 1.0 releases; when I get a summary next week I'll
fill in Arm news specifically.

### Qualcomm demo at Kubecon

Packet and Qualcomm have a demo running at Kubecon using
Alexa and OpenFaaS. The technology stack includes Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
Docker and Docker Swarm, and OpenFaaS serving up slides and 
executing functions based on voice commands - all running on
a Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor at Packet.
