this issue.

### Can bugs be useful? Some famous bugs. (John Gall)

> The very word "Bug" suggests something worthless if not actually
repulsive, something suitable only to be eliminated. Yet every Bug, no
matter how humble, gives us at least one important piece of
information; namely, it tells us one more way our System can fail.
Since success is largely a matter of Avoiding the Most Likely Ways to
Fail, and since every Bug advances us significantly along that path, we
may hearken back to the advice given in the preface and urge the following
Policy: CHERISH YOUR BUGS. STUDY THEM.

John Gall, The Systems Bible, 3d Edition ("Systemantics").

### Kubecon news (Dan Kohn, CNCF)

4000 people are at the CNCF Kubernetes conference, Kubecon, in Austin TX. It
snowed there in a rare December snowstorm. Among the most controversial items
that have come to my attention there is how to pronounce `kubectl`. Lots of
demos and lots of news of 1.0 releases; when I get a summary next week I'll
fill in Arm news specifically.

### Ceph charms for Juju for Ubuntu (via Jeff Underhill, Arm)

The 17.11 OpenStack Charm release bundles for Ceph and OpenStack are now available from Canonical for Ubuntu Linux. These have been tested and validated on Arm. This is a great milestone for Arm as all major blockers inhibiting a market ready deployment of OpenStack and Ceph on Arm are now addressed!
