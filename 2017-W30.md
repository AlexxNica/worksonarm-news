### Go 1.9 RC 1

The Go programming language has [announced availability of Go 1.9 RC 1]
to the community. This release reflects the
stability of Go 1.9, and as part of the test process Google
puts Go release candidates into production.

Like the earlier beta releases of Go, this version comes
with ARM64 binaries, which are available for you to test.
There are a small number of bugs still remaining, with
at this writing 4 open and 609 closed on the Go 1.9 milestone.

Benchmarks of any complex system will depend heavily on your
workload. [One benchmark report] provided on a single-core A57
platform shows speedups of anywhere from negligible to over 2x
on a standardized workload. Your benchmark experience will differ.

Go 1.9 release notes are not finished, but a
set of [draft release notes for Go 1.9] includes this statement:

> The release adds transparent monotonic time support, parallelizes
compilation of functions within a package, better supports test
helper functions, includes a new bit manipulation package, and has
a new concurrent map type.

The parallel function compilation will be a substantial
benefit on server-class ARM systems that have lots of cores.

### Docker 17.07 RC 1

Docker has made available a first release candidate of their 17.07
Community Edition software. For the first time, 17.07 includes ARM64
binaries, and it re-introduces support for Raspbian on 32-bit ARMv7
systems.

Docker has a rolling release schedule, and 17.07-ce when it ships
will be a monthly "edge" option. From the Docker documentation:

> Docker CE and EE are released quarterly, and CE also has a monthly
"Edge" option. Each Docker EE release is supported and maintained
for one year and receives security and critical bug fixes during
that period. We are also improving Docker CE maintainability by
maintaining each quarterly CE release for 4 months. That gets Docker
CE users a new 1-month window to update from one version to the
next.

Like any beta and release candidate software, there are known issues
which have some expectation of being fixed before the release goes 
official. In this particular case, 32-bit and 64-bit ARM systems
may experience difficulties with Docker Swarm mode, resulting from
inconsistencies in naming of various ARM variants. A suggested
workaround bypasses the name check with the option `--no-resolve-image`.

The details can
be found in this [SwarmKit issue], and the blocking bug described
in this [moby issue]. If one were to want to dive straight into
the responsible code, it lives in the scheduler filter at

### Naming things

> There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation,
naming things, and off-by-1 errors. -- Leon Bambrick

The problem experienced by Docker is not unique to that project,
or even to computer science in general. Sometimes, two different
systems give different names for the same thing, and there's a
need to normalize names to a single well-known form so that something
like a scheduler can know that it's safe to execute code on this
system. 

As a for instance, 64-bit ARM systems are variably known
as arm64, armv8, arm64v8, and aarch64. For 32-bit ARM systems there
are even more variants. Different systems may have different capabilities
of running 32-bit codes on 64-bit systems, but there is not one
single unifying name for that capacity. 

To add to the confusion, cross-compilation may create an artifact that
was built on one operating system and processor type, but that actually
contains executable code for another system.
