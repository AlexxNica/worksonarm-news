### Port: Elasticsearch to ARM

[Elastic] is working on a port to [Elasticsearch] to ARM.
Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine with a REST API.
[Drew Raines] is leading up the effort, which is
nearing the point where the test suite completes without
error. Drew writes:

[Elastic]:https://www.elastic.co/
[Elasticsearch]:https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch
[Drew Raines]:https://github.com/drewr

> These commits produce a working Elasticsearch binary and get the
full test suite to pass. It has not been tested in any production
capacity. 

https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/25318

### Call to action: Test Go 1.9 Beta 1; Go floating point.

Go 1.9 Beta 1 is in a test phase. If your project requires
Go, please put together a simple test plan that includes 
the Go 1.9 Beta 1 binary release. Feedback of any sort,
including benchmarks, build tests, or especially documentation,
are all welcomed.

https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19082

One open issue that will not be addressed in Go 1.9, however, is
discrepancies in the math libraries that result in exp(1) giving
different results depending on what hardware you are using.  In
issue golang/go 20319 the analysis is that some platforms use
assembly language and others use Go do to floating point.  "amd64
and s390x have assembly implementations, all the others architectures
use a pure go routine and they implement different algorithms, so
last-bit-mismatches are not unexpected."

https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20319

The Go (golang) page on Works on ARM has been updated with
the latest information; see http://worksonarm.com/golang for more
details.

### Call to action: Test Rust 1.18 on ARM!

"Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety."

Rust 1.18 has been released; the release notes suggest
performance improvements in the compiler.

### Hardware: Qualcomm Centriq 2400

Packet is [showcasing] Qualcomm's new Centriq 2400 at 
developer conferences and providing attendees access to a number
of demos that use open source tools such as Ansible, Terraform,
Docker and Kubernetes. These demos of Qualcomm
Datacenter Technologies’ ARM architecture-based servers 
are at Red Hat’s [AnsibleFest] conference in London, and also
be present at [Hashiconf] in Austin, the [Open Source Summit North America] 
in Los Angeles, and [AnsibleFest] in San Francisco.

### Distro: Fedora 26 Beta

Fedora announced Fedora 26 Beta, which has support for ARM.  "A
Beta release is code-complete and bears a very strong resemblance
to the third and final release. The final release of Fedora 26 is
expected in July."

### CI: Gitlab CI Omnibus for ARM

An open issue in the continuous integration world is how
best and easiest to run on ARM. One aspect of this is Gitlab,
and there's an open issue in the Omnibus Gitlab project
for how to get your Gitlab CI completely self-hosted on ARM.
