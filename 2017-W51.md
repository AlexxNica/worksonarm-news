### Google Container Registry supporting multiarch (via Phil Estes)

The Google Container Registry is now supporting containers with
"fat manifests", the technique necessary to provide multi-architecture
support. This was announced on the sig-cluster-lifecycle call and posted
to the #multi-platform channel on the Kubernetes slack by 
Lucas Käldström quoting Phil Estes:

> It's a Christmas miracle! gcr.io registry is open for business
with multi-platform "manifest list" images! // cc: @kubernetesonarm
for the tip

The impact of this is to allow official Kubernetes images to support
multiple architectures, thus paving the way in Kubernetes 1.10 to
have true multi-architecture support.

### NixOS testing on arm64 (Graham Christensen)

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager,
it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and
has many other advantages.

NixOS has started testing on aarch64 (arm64) using the Works
on Arm infrastructure. A community host has been set up for
build and deploy infrastructure through the Works on Arm cluster.

> Super cool: #NixOS community member Dezgeg has the first automatic
NixOS VM test working on ARM aarch64!

### Rook, a cloud-native storage system (via Brad Cohen, Quantum)

Rook is a cloud-native storage system based on Ceph and designed for
use with Kubernetes. It provides file, block, and object storage.
Rook is available via Docker Hub. A beta version of Rook (release
0.7) will be available in December 2017, followed by a production-ready
version in early 2018.

> Quantum Corp. announced that Rook, the open source project it
initiated just over a year ago, has gained support in the developer
community and continues to deliver against key enterprise feature
requirements as the project progresses.

### Kata Containers CI (James Kulina, Hyper.SH)

Kata Containers is a virtualized container runtime project aimed
at securing containers through use of hypervisor and hardware
enforced isolation. The project has been approved for the Works
on Arm cluster to do continuous integration on Arm.

The Kata Containers project is managed by OpenStack Foundation.
