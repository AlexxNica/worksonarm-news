### Google Container Registry supporting multiarch (via Phil Estes, IBM)

The Google Container Registry is now supporting containers with
"fat manifests", the technique necessary to provide multi-architecture
support. This was announced on the sig-cluster-lifecycle call and posted
to the #multi-platform channel on the Kubernetes slack by 
Lucas KÃ¤ldstrÃ¶m quoting Phil Estes:

> It's a Christmas miracle! gcr.io registry is open for business
with multi-platform "manifest list" images! // cc: @kubernetesonarm
for the tip

The impact of this is to allow official Kubernetes images to support
multiple architectures, thus paving the way in Kubernetes 1.10 to
have true multi-architecture support.

### NixOS testing on arm64 (Graham Christensen)

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager,
it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and
has many other advantages.

NixOS has started testing on aarch64 (arm64) using the Works
on Arm infrastructure. A community host has been set up for
build and deploy infrastructure through the Works on Arm cluster.

> Super cool: #NixOS community member Dezgeg has the first automatic
NixOS VM test working on ARM aarch64!

### Rook, a cloud-native storage system (via Brad Cohen, Quantum)

Rook is a cloud-native storage system based on Ceph and designed for
use with Kubernetes. It provides file, block, and object storage.
Rook is available via Docker Hub. A beta version of Rook (release
0.7) will be available in December 2017, followed by a production-ready
version in early 2018.

> Quantum Corp. announced that Rook, the open source project it
initiated just over a year ago, has gained support in the developer
community and continues to deliver against key enterprise feature
requirements as the project progresses.

### Xen Hypervisor 4.10

The Xen project announced release 4.10 of the Xen Hypervisor. 
Release notes follow for Xen on Arm:

> Support for Latest System-on-chip (SoC) Technology: The Xen Project
now supports SoCs based on the 64-bit Armv8-A architecture from
Qualcomm Centriq 2400 and Cavium ThunderX.

> SBSA UART Emulation for ArmÂ® CPUs: Implementation of SBSA UART
emulation support in the in the Xen Project Hypervisor makes it
accessible through the command line tools. This enables the guest
OS to access the console when no PV console driver is present. In
addition, the SBSA UART emulation is also required to be compliant
with the VM System specification.

> ITS support for ARM CPUs: Xen Project 4.10 adds support for ARMâ€™s
Interrupt Translation Service (ITS), which accompanies the GICv3
interrupt controller such as the ARM CoreLink GIC-500. ITS support
allows the Xen Project Hypervisor to harnesses all of the benefits
of the GICv3 architecture, improving interrupt efficiency and
allowing for greater virtualization on-chip for both those using
the Xen Project for the server and embedded space. ITS support is
essential to virtualize systems with large amounts of interrupts.
In addition ITS increases isolation of virtual machines by providing
interrupt remapping, enabling safe PCI passthrough on ARM..

> GRUB2 on 64-bit Armv8-A architecture: The GRUB community merged
support to boot Xen on 64-bit Arm-based CPU platforms. GRUB2 support
for Armv8-A improves the user experience when installing Xen via
distribution package on UEFI platform.

### Kata Containers CI (James Kulina, Hyper.SH)

Kata Containers is a virtualized container runtime project aimed
at securing containers through use of hypervisor and hardware
enforced isolation. The project has been approved for the Works
on Arm cluster to do continuous integration on arm64.

The Kata Containers project is managed by OpenStack Foundation.
