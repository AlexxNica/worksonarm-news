### Mergers and acquisitions: Marvell to buy Cavium

LEAD STORY REUTERS

> Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd (MRVL.O) said on Monday
it would buy smaller rival Cavium Inc (CAVM.O) in a deal valued at
about $6 billion, as it seeks to gain scale in a semiconductor
industry that is rapidly consolidating.

LEADERSHIP CHANGES SEEKING ALPHA Stephen Alpher

> Marvell CEO Matt Murphy will run the merged company, and Cavium
CEO Syed Ali will continue as strategic advisor and member of the
board.

TRADE PRESS ARS TECHNICA VALENTINA PALLADINO @valentinalucia

> Bermuda-based Marvell makes semiconductors for data-storage devices
while California-based Cavium produces communications and networking
chips. The deal better positions Marvell to compete with bigger
rivals, including Intel and Broadcom, in a semiconductor industry
that has changed a lot over the past couple years as companies buy
out rivals.

ANALYST RESPONSE TIRIAS RESEARCH IS CAVIUM UNDERVALUED

> Cray showed its high-end XC50 supercomputer board containing four
two-socket Cavium server nodes (eight processors in all). Cray’s
endorsement of the ARMv8 instruction set via Cavium’s ThunderX2
processor is a watershed event for the Arm server field in general
and specifically for Cavium. I think it credibly moves Arm way past
the “is it performant in servers” question. I never imagined that
I would use the words “Cray” and “Arm” in the same sentence.
